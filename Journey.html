Hope you are doing well. Just to let you know about my hobbies. I do a lots of things in my free time, actually I do these things whenever I want regardless of free 
time. Which I know is not good but it never bothers me:) Most of the time I code. I learnt C++ and still coding in world's best programming language. Lately I have 
learnt C (which mainly differs in input, output and strings from basic c++, so I learnt these 3 things). I have spent almost 400 hours in programming. Couldn't do 
anything significant so far but I still enjoy it(?). In this immense world of Programming I do Compettitive programimng in short cp. Because of the presence of many 
distractions I couldn't go far than pupil level in codeforces(<a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/ph0enlx" target="_blank"> main</a> &
<a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/runninglow" target="_blank"> alternative</a>) and 2 star in 
codechef(<a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/running_low" target="_blank"> **</a>). That's all about cp. Now let's move to "Shokher Robotics". Though I have
mentioned that word but Robotics has nothing to do with me except creating massive interest. Few months ago, I built a bluthtooth controlled car and whenever 
someone comes to our house my mom can forget to offer them food but can never forget to <a href="file:///E:/Site/bc%20car.html" target=_blank>flex</a> about the car. That's my achievement in this realm. Ok now let's turn to 
next one. Wow u still have interest? This one is a bit interesting. Game development-Yeah I made a game. Want to build more but time he kaha? In case you want to see
<a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/build-5ka" target="_blank"> Jump as high as you can</a>.
Let's put an end to this chapter. Chess - which I spent my time the most. I actually shouldn't say spent I should say
<a href="https://www.chess.com/member/afifa1907" target="_blank">wasted</a> cause it's nearly 
450 hours in chess.com and another 50 hour watching
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GothamChess" target="_blank"> Levy Rozman's</a>
videos.Got the 1300 as highest and fell again. Hope to get back that rating one day. But I spent
the time in chess so unconstructively. So it took me from nothing to nothing. Rubic's cube comes next. Back in 2020, I solved the classic cube for the first time which I 
bought 3 years back then. Then without learning speed cubing I bought 4 more cube. Yeah that's me:) I bought another one several months ago and left it without 
learning. Here comes the last one Flute. For me this is the most precious thing I own. And most wonderful hobby of mine but irony is that I gave it the least amount
of time. I am gonna play it soulfully someday in a parallel univarse maybe. You can hear <a href="file:///E:/Site/huh.html" target=_blank>terriable</a> sound of this beautiful instrument(don't mind). Am I flexing that I do a
number of things? No, I'm not. Just wanted to tell you about a somehow lost winner. Let's look back to the journey one more time. Appearrently it's quite disappointing.
But I explored lots of worlds. Shouldn't I be happy? Couldn't I be happy?</font></h4></p>
